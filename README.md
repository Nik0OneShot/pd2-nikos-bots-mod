# pd2-nikos-bots-mod
a "better" bots mod that makes the bots more balanced over making them overpowered.

this is designed to be used with useful bots, but it should work just fine on it's own.

note that this **exclusively** works in singleplayer. it will not work online, even if all players have the mod. this is to avoid desync issues.

changes:

1- bots have lower health values.

(1000 on easy, normal, hard, very hard, and overkill, 2000 on mayhem and death wish, 4000 on death sentence.)

2- bots have slightly higher bleedout health values.

(500 on easy, normal, hard, very hard, and overkill, 1000 on mayhem and death wish, 2000 on death sentence.)

3- bots have slightly longer regeneration times.

(2s on easy, normal, hard, very hard, and overkill, 4s on mayhem and death wish, 6s on death sentence)

4- bots have new and unique presets.

bots have no falloff, no aim delays, slightly longer focus delays, slightly slower reload times, and slightly tweaked reload times. their default weapon is now the AMCAR rifle.

bots have a unique dodge preset meant to emulate PDTH's dodge, the difference being they can shoot whilst doing so.

bots have a slightly edited detection preset, making their vision cone larger and their distance is longer.

bots have a new move speed preset, making them slower yet capable of moving at full speed regardless of direction.

bots have lower grace period, they get out of cuffs faster and their hurt severity is changed to a slight twitch per shot.

bots stay where they are told to be, instead of moving with you if you go too far.

bots have no start or stop animations, and they always face their enemy.

5- converts no longer stagger, have no start or stop animations, and they always face their enemy.
